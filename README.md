# Dog or Cat to Human Age Calculator

## Description

The "Animal Age to Human Age Calculator" is a Python program designed to determine the human age equivalent of a given animal's age, specifically for dogs and cats. The program prompts the user to input the type of animal (either "dog" or "cat") and the animal's age in years. It then calculates and displays the corresponding human age based on predefined conversion rules for each animal type.

## For dogs:

The program uses a specific conversion formula:
- 12 human years for the first dog year.
- 24 human years for the second dog year.
- For each subsequent dog year beyond the second, it adds 4 human years for every additional dog year.

## For cats:

The program follows a similar conversion approach:
- 15 human years for the first cat year.
- 24 human years for the second cat year.
- It also adds 4 human years for every subsequent cat year beyond the second.
- The program ensures that the user's input is case-insensitive and provides clear instructions for correct input. If the user enters an invalid animal type (other than "dog" or "cat"), the program notifies the user and prompts them to enter a valid animal type.

This program provides a quick and convenient way to estimate the human age equivalent of a dog or cat's age, helping pet owners understand and relate to their pets' aging process.
